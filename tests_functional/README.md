# Functional Tests

The tests are designed to run on different versions of stylelint to ensure compatibility and to catch any potential
issues early.

The tests are automatically triggered by the Gitlab CI/CD pipeline defined in the [tests.yml](../.gitlab/ci/tests.yml)
file. Each commit and merge request will initiate the tests to validate the changes.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue on
the Gitlab Issues page. Provide as much detail as possible to help us address the problem quickly.
